            Thanks to you, Alice was able to open the gate and also retrieve his new password. You feeling happy; go to the E-Vending machine nearby because you also want to enjoy the evening with a snack, without a snack what the hell will you enjoy?
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the E-Vending machine is also corrupted because It is rarely used and this also proves how damned unlucky you are by the way. So, now to grab a snack- You have to fix the E-Vending software. The software works fine but just needs to be set in such a manner that it accepts credit card successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lucky you, the source code is present there and there is a configuration file (cfg) along with it. The config file is used during compilation and which results into a secret encryption key later on to help the software run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The source code has an error in its logic and is not turning the config into a real secret key. All you need to do is to fix the logic and run the program to get the secret key and facilitate the software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, the code has comments on it which describe how the config file is turned into a secret key, which are as following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Most important comment! Spaces in the CFG file must be eradicated before anything else otherwise the key will be generated wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
                From the config file, take all the integers (number between strings, like if AB12CD then the integer is 12 not 1 and 2 seperately) and change them to alphabet according to following rule:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The integers less than zero and equal to zero must be converted into o.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integers greater than zero must be converted to alphabets like: 1 to A, 2 to B, 3 to C and so on. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The integers greater than 26 must be converted to % sign if the number is odd and to & if the number is even.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Now all we have is alphabets and % and &, lowercase and uppercase. These must be collected in such a way that the previous collected ones are not repeated. In this case, lowercase and uppercase are different entities. Like if A is already in the resultant collection, a can be added but A can not be added again. Following this rule, you have to collect all the alphabets and make sure that you are not changing the order in which they occur like: “aPndAhduUamsP” is changed into “aPndAhuUms”. Same goes for % and & signs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thats the secret key- Woah.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            You have to find the secret key and insert in the E-Vending machine’s software so that you can purchase a snack later on.
        </p>

            Following is the cfg file obtained from that machine:
