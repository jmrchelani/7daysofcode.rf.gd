            This league will have two type of questions, one is going to be of direct type where the question will be of one or two lines and you will have to give answer. The other type is like theoretical where you have to read the whole question and answer accordingly with a given input. That requires a little bit more patience and skills. Day 1 to Day 4 contains direct questions whereas Day 5 to Day 7 have theoretical questions.

            The questions from 1 - 4 are taken from Project Euler and The question number 5,6 and 7 are written by me myself. You can find the first four questions on internet and their solutions as well. But it is pointless to answer these questions without your own efforts. But, You cant find the questions written by me on internet so Good luck with that :D
